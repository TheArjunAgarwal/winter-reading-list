    pitch: "Dark, sad and emotionally draining. Arundhati Roy's deeply intellectual style combined with a personal narrative. \nWe are used to seeing the world in black and white, we want easy answers, easy solutions, easy categorizations, quick labels for people. In real life, it’s not always that simple.",
    whyOnList: "Because the anonymous suggester said they really wanted to read this and wanted motivation. Also, we had heard good things about the book.\nThe story is about the complex and multi-layered relationship of two remarkable but flawed women.\nThough not as well-known as her daughter, Mary Roy was too a remarkable woman: a formidable feminist and an inspiring educator who transformed many lives in Kerala. However, she too was not without her flaws. Mother Mary Comes to Me reveals the fullness, trouble and tumult, of her legacy through the eyes of her 'valiant organ-child'. As it follows the separate but interminably linked journeys of the two women, Mary and Arundhati, it shapes up into an unflinching, honest portrait of the complexity and irreducibility of human relationships – of love."

    pitch: "The quintessential dark academia book. Not only did it pioneer a genre, it basically gave birth to an aesthetic. I'll let the blurb do rest of the talking:\nUnder the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality they slip gradually from obsession to corruption and betrayal, and at last inexorably—into evil.",
    whyOnList: "It is a modern classic and has one of the best blurbs of like all time. Also, it is a fun and easy read."

    pitch: "The person who suggested this said: \"It's a book about friendship, love and more friendship. and games! It's a perfect read for the vacations\" and we couldn't agree more. It was the 2022 Goodreads choice award winner (Fiction).",
    whyOnList: "From the book's blurb:\nSpanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before."
